#Moochify

####Authors
James Felz, Vivek Shah, Paul Garbett

The app that connects neighbors, allowing them to share tools & equipment with each other.

Moochify is the best way to use equipment when you need it. Itâ€™s an open and convenient approach to sharing. Owners earn money from their investment, and neighbors avoid buying unnecessary equipment. Unlike Craigslist, Moochify lets people share rather than sell.
